1. "The visibility of system status"


"The visibility of system status" is playing an important rule for user experience design. The reason is that it can should user the reasonable that when they are downloading something they are very clear how long they have to wait. So users will know what is going on inside of the system. For example, the website of FindSisterHood shows users simple definitions on the begining page. When user scroll down, they can see Users should always be able to understand meaning without having to go look up the definition of the website in a search engine. It give users clear definitions which is easy to understand and clarify exactly what preventive care is and why it is important. It also provides answers to basic questions about preventive care and explains whatâ€™s included in the benefits of FindSIsterHood.

2. "Match Between the System and the Real World"

It is also very important which is like "The visibility of system status". For example, the language of the website and app of FindSisterHood shows users the words and concepts like "feed", "my questions, "post", "following", and "options". All of these are things users are familiar with from the real world and they are words in the app for showing users too. 
It gives expectations of users and their prior experiences with real-world. The full trash image can remind users that it is time to throw those trash away in their laptop. Also, the Calendar icon in users' websites is designed like the real world wall Calendar.

3. "User control and freedom" 

It has been playing important rule for users. Everytime when I use the app of FindSisterHood to post a messege to share with others, I suddenly change my mind, and I can right click the option which is unsend or delete. Once I unsend the message, it will no longer be visible to people included in the conversation.

4. "Consistency and standads" 

It can make users have more confident using the website/ APP. For example, when users use the app of  FindSisterHood, users are moving from one screen to another, the user should not feel as if they have arrived at a new website. For example, when people use the App, the floating action buttons do not change their positions. The only thing that changes is the icon that represents the action on the screen. It is aimed to create a usable and consistent experience for the users. The users will not feel confused when they use the app.

5. "Error Prevention"

After the user has the confident keep using the App/ website, "Error Prevention" will play the importnat rule. The reason is that users are humans. Everyone will make mistakes. We will not only make mistakes sometimes but also forget somethings sometimes. For example, when the user does not type anything on the message box and click "POST", the app will show user the error prevention. It lets users know if they have forgottten to actually attach anything. It is good that it can remind me users to avoid making mistakes. So the app does a good job that make sure users should always keep an eye to avoid the mistakes by giving appropriate suggestions and notifications when needed which is very important. Because we have to keep making users feel confident use the website/APP. The app can notifys users that if they forgot to add the attachment or if they forgot their posts.

6. "Recognition rather than recall"

It plays the important rule here because Users do not spend forever to think about that options should like type. They are given options to choose from which save lots of times for the users. Those options can remind users' previous experiences. The users do not have to think too much or recall her/his memory to complete the tasks.


7.  "Flexibility and Efficiency of Use"

This app is not very flexible for users to use because it cannot change a lot things on the app. It just keeps it simple, and it does not let users change lot of settings.  It only shows users how to change the color on the app which is "Choose your color".  It will be nice if it can allow users to change several things on the settings, such as it can design that the user can choose the people who can see the user's posts or who cannot see the posts to share the post with, etc. 


8. "Aesthetic and Minimalist Design 

We knows that aesthetics of design  is playing an important rule for the visual attractibeness of an App or a product. This app is very pinky, however, not all of users like using the website which is very pinky. It might make the users who does not like pink color give up using the app very fast. So it will be nice if the app can add more aesthetic design to catch users' eyes including other colors instead of using lots of pink color. 

9. "Help User recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from errors."

This app gives the users hard time to figure out about the "share" icon. It does not allow user to share on other social media even though it should Instagram icon. Hoever, when users click the Insatgram icon, it show the error icon which keeps moving in a circle. It makes users confused about they do not even know what is going on. It does not even give users any error message letting users know what is the icon meaning. It makes the user have no idea if Instagram not working or the app is stuck.


10. "Help and Documentation"

This is nice that the app provides a message box and their email for encouraging users to contact with the team of the App. Also, if users want to know more details or need help, they can feel free to report comments or answers about the App. The teams of the App will contact and answer users' questions in 48 hours.
